# Character Input

Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

Extras:

2. Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines.

# Odd Or Even
Exercise 2
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.

Extras:

1. If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
2. Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.
